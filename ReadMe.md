## What this project is about?

This project was designed to deepen my understanding of NestJS and React Native by building a full-stack application. I wanted to gain hands-on experience with NestJS for the back-end and React Native for the front-end, allowing me to enhance my skills in both areas. Through this project, I have been able to explore these technologies in a practical context, creating something functional that I can continue to expand and refine as I learn and grow.
